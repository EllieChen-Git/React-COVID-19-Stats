### Project Goals (What I want to learn/practice in this project)

- Refresh my knowledge of consuming public API & learn how to consume Google Maps API
- Use TypeScript to write React App (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
- Use Material UI for design (I'm more experienced in Bootstrap)
- Implement end-to-end testing: cypress (or other end-to-end testing)

---

### Building Process

1. Brainstormed side project ideas
2. Located the API I wanted to use
3. Quick wireframing of the site
4. Created app with 'create-react-app' and setup README file
5. Broke down the components & time estimation
